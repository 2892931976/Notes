# Failed to Install Centos 7 via USB Disk

It stopped at `/dev/root does not exist in CentOS 7`

#### Root Cause
It maybe caused by writting the ISO to the USB disk via [YUMI](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/)

#### How to Fix
* Use [Win32DiskImager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) to create the USB Disk

#### Clean the USB Disk After Installation

* [Clean the USB Disk Created by Win32DiskImager](https://github.com/northbright/Notes/blob/master/Software/win32diskimager/clean_the_usb_disk_created_by_win32diskimager/clean_the_usb_disk_create_by_win32diskimager.md)
